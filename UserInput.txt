2		:Insert the number one to simulate the CSTR heating system OR the number two to simulate the level control system.
-9		:Enter your desired time increment in seconds.
60		:Enter your desired runtime in seconds.
2		:Enter the number one to simulate a change in set point OR the number two to simulate a disturbance to your selected process.
0		:If you chose a setpoint, please insert your desired setpoint (For CSTR heating system, the change is on Q and for the level system, the change is on___). Enter the number zero here if you chose a disturbance.
0		:Please enter the time you would like to start your change in setpoint in s. Enter the number zero here if you chose a disturbance.
0 		:If you chose a disturbance, please insert disturbance gain.(For the CSTR system, you are varying inlet temperature and for level, you are varying _).Enter the number zero here if you chose a change in setpoint.
0 		:Please enter the start time of your disturbance in s. Enter the number zero here if you chose a change in setpoint.
0		:Please enter the end time of your disturbance in s. Enter the number zero here if you chose a change in setpoint.
0.001		:Enter your reponse tolerance (tolerance for the difference between the simulation output and your desired setpoint).
5		:Please enter the gain of the valve you are using.
3		:Please enter the time constant of that valve.
I		:In the order of Proportional (P), Integral (I) and Derivative (D) controller actions, enter (in capital letters) which actions you would like to simulate. Ex: Enter PD for a proportional derivative controller.
1		:Indicate your desired controller gain Kc.
6		:Indicate your desired controller integral time constant tauI (applicable if you would like to ).
0		:Indicate your desired controlled derivative time constant tauD (if applicable).
5		:For process one, enter the initial temperature [K]. For process two, enter the height of your tank [m].
74		:For process one, enter the mass flow rate of the fluid entering the system [kg/s]. For process two, enter the diameter of your tank [m].
4		:For process one, enter the heat capacity of the fluid in the system [kJ/kg*K]. For process two, enter the initial the level of the fluid in your tank [m]. 
888		:For process one, enter the heat input rate [kJ/s]. For process two, enter the volumetric flow of your process [m3/s].
4		:For process one, enter the volume of the tank [m3]. For process two, enter the Cv* valve characteristic.
0		:For process one, enter the density of the fluid you are using [kg/m3]. For process two, enter the number zero.
