1		:Insert 1 to simulate the CSTR heating system OR 2 to simulate the level control system.
2		:Enter 1 to simulate a change in set point OR 2 to simulate a disturbance to your selected process.
0		:If you chose a setpoint, please insert your desired setpoint (For CSTR heating system, the change is on Q and for the level system, the change is on___). Enter 0 here if you chose a disturbance.
0		:Please enter the time you would like to start your change in setpoint in s. Enter 0 here if you chose a disturbance.
0 		:If you chose a disturbance, please insert disturbance gain.(For the CSTR system, you are varying inlet temperature and for level, you are varying _).Enter 0 here if you chose a change in setpoint.
0 		:Please enter the start time of your disturbance in s. Enter 0 here if you chose a change in setpoint.
0		:Please enter the end time of your disturbance in s. Enter 0 here if you chose a change in setpoint.
10		:Enter your desired time increment in seconds (ex: simulate the control loop every 5 s).
60		:Enter your desired runtime in seconds.
0.001		:Enter your reponse tolerance (tolerance for the difference between the simulation output and your desired setpoint).
5		:Please enter the gain of the valve you are using.
3		:Please enter the time constant of that valve.
I		:In the order of Proportional (P), Integral (I) and Derivative (D) controller actions, enter (in capital letters) which actions you would like to simulate. Ex: Enter PD for a proportional derivative controller.
1		:Indicate your desired controller gain Kc.
6		:Indicate your desired controller integral time constant tauI (applicable if you would like to ).
0		:Indicate your desired controlled derivative time constant tauD (if applicable).
