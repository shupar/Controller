2	Insert 1 to simulate the CSTR heating system OR 2 to simulate the level control system.
	Enter 1 to simulate a step change OR 2 to simulate a disturbance to your selected process.
5	If you chose a step change, please insert your desired step (For CSTR heating system, the change is on Q and for the level ysstem, the change is on___).
7 30 60	If you chose a disturbance, please insert disturbance gain, and between which times (in s) you would like to impose it on the system. Put a space in between each element. Ex: gain of 5 between 30 and 60s would be 5 30 60 (For the CSTR system, you are varying inlet temperature and for level, you are varying _)
	Enter your desired time increment in seconds (ex: simulate the control loop every 5 s).
	Enter your desired runtime.
	Enter your process output target (i.e. your setpoint).
	Enter your reponse tolerance (tolerance for the difference between the simulation output and your desired setpoint).
	In the order of Proportional (P), Integral (I) and Derivative (D) controller actions, enter (in letters) which actions you would like to simulate. Ex: Enter PD for a proportional derivative controller.
	Indicate your desired controller gain Kc (if applicable).
	Indicate your desired controller integral time constant tauI (if applicable).
	Indicate your desired controlled integral time constant tauD (if applicable).
	Please enter the gain of the valve you are using.
	Please enter the time constant of that valve.
