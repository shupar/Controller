1		:Insert 1 to simulate the CSTR heating system OR 2 to simulate the level control system.
2		:Enter 1 to simulate a step change OR 2 to simulate a disturbance to your selected process.
5		:If you chose a step change, please insert your desired step as an integer value (For CSTR heating system, the change is on Q and for the level ysstem, the change is on___).
5 15 30		:If you chose a disturbance, please insert disturbance gain, and between which times (in s) you would like to impose it on the system. All number have to be integers. Put a space in between each element. Ex: gain of 5 between 30 and 60s would be 5 30 60 (For the CSTR system, you are varying inlet temperature and for level, you are varying _)
10		:Enter your desired time increment in seconds (ex: simulate the control loop every 5 s).
60		:Enter your desired runtime in seconds.
5.55		:Enter your process output target (i.e. your setpoint).
0.001		:Enter your reponse tolerance (tolerance for the difference between the simulation output and your desired setpoint).
5		:Please enter the gain of the valve you are using.
3		:Please enter the time constant of that valve.
PD		:In the order of Proportional (P), Integral (I) and Derivative (D) controller actions, enter (in letters) which actions you would like to simulate. Ex: Enter PD for a proportional derivative controller.
5		:Indicate your desired controller gain Kc (if applicable).
6		:Indicate your desired controller integral time constant tauI (if applicable).
7		:Indicate your desired controlled derivative time constant tauD (if applicable).
